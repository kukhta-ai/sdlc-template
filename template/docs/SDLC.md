# Development SDLC — sequence

The autonomous, BMAD-based development process for this repo, as a sequence diagram. This is the
**authoritative, complete picture** of the flow `AGENTS.md` encodes; read them together. Text/Mermaid so it
lives in version control and an agent can parse it directly (no HTML/browser needed).

This diagram covers the **Full SDLC development** process. It is not the default for questions, setup help,
Git work, or focused edits; `AGENTS.md` routes those through focused work.

Personas are persistent BMAD subagents — **spawned once, resumed** for each later call in their lifetime
(`SPAWN` vs `RESUME` below). Development is **sequential**: one worker active at a time, a single working
tree, story sub-branches via `checkout -b` (not worktrees). `[GATE]` marks a human approval point — stop
and wait. Git operations are called out on the `git` lifeline.

> This is the full greenfield pipeline: the planning personas build the design set from the product idea. In
> a project that **already has a committed design set**, Phases 1–3 become conformance reviews — the planning
> personas run the same workflows but *steered from the committed docs* (see `AGENTS.md` → "How the design
> set maps onto BMAD") rather than designing from scratch. The branch names (`feature/<epic>`,
> `feature/<epic>-task-<id>`) and gates are identical either way.

## Legend

- **SPAWN** — start a persistent subagent for a role (first call in its lifetime).
- **RESUME** — re-enter an already-spawned subagent, preserving its context.
- **[GATE]** — a human approval point; the agent stops and waits.
- **solid arrow** — a call; **dashed arrow** — its return.
- Branch topology: `main → dev → feature/<epic> → feature/<epic>-task-<id>`, with `fix/<epic>/<issue>`
  opened only at the epic gate on failure. Story branches merge back `--no-ff` and are then deleted. The
  story branch joins the segment with a **hyphen** (not a slash) so it can coexist with the `feature/<epic>`
  ref — see `CONTRIBUTING.md` → Branching model.

## Persona → BMAD module map

| Persona | BMAD source | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| analyst, pm, ux-designer, architect, sm, tea, tech-writer | **BMM** module (`npx bmad-method install --modules bmm`) | the core SDLC roles + their workflows |
| tea + the `testarch-*` workflows | **TEA** module (`--modules tea`) | test design, framework, ci, trace, nfr, atdd, automate, test-review |
| worker / automator loop (`story-automator`, `story-automator-review`) | **automator** (`--modules automator`) | the per-story build→review automation in Phase 5 |
| worker (dev), investigator, retro | roles spun from BMM `dev`/`qa` + the `retrospective` workflow | implement stories, debug at the gate, write the epic retro |
| CodeGraph + Serena | installed by `scripts/setup.sh` with telemetry disabled | optional read-only discovery for impact, call paths, and symbol references |
| `.sdlc/processes/*.md` | locally installed extensions, if present | active process registrations with declared state, compatibility, checks, and exit conditions |

See `AGENTS.md` for how to install these, initialize the persistent specialists, and track SDLC state, and
the `README.md` for the bootstrap.
